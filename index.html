	<p align="center">An American media franchise and shared universe that is centered on a series 
	of superhero films, independently produced by Marvel Studios and based on characters
	that appear in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The franchise has 
	expanded to include comic books, short films, television series, and digital series.
	The shared universe, much like the original Marvel Universe in comic books, was estab
	lished by crossing over common plot elements, settings, cast, and characters. Phil Coulson
	, portrayed by Clark Gregg, is an original character to the MCU and the only character 
	to appear across all the different media of the MCU.</p>
	<p align="center">The database stores data about movies that were produced by Marvel Studios which contains some sample data. The database currently contains data that associates with the movies that were produced. For example, we have some data on movies such as Iron man, Iron man 2, Captain America: The First Avenger, The Incredible Hulk, Thor, and more. By using the web page, users will be able to interact with it and obtain information about these movies. The web page contains different tabs that has different functionalities, each tab has features that makes it easier for users to access/edit the data from the database. From the web page, a user can search data on any movie that is in the database. And, with the right privileges, a user can also insert/update new data in the database, or delete certain data from the database. They can also get reports using the report tab on the web page, which uses group-By queries to generate reports. By using this web page we are eliminating the hassle of interacting with the actual database, in order to get any information about the database. </p>
