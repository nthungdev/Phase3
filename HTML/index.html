	<p align="center">An American media franchise and shared universe that is centered on a series 
	of superhero films, independently produced by Marvel Studios and based on characters
	that appear in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The franchise has 
	expanded to include comic books, short films, television series, and digital series.
	The shared universe, much like the original Marvel Universe in comic books, was estab
	lished by crossing over common plot elements, settings, cast, and characters. Phil Coulson
	, portrayed by Clark Gregg, is an original character to the MCU and the only character 
	to appear across all the different media of the MCU.</p></div>
